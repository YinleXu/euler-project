; though this procedure takes account of number base (as 2nd input argument)
; it would not work properly except for decimal base (base-10)
; to get different base work, algebraic operations used have to adjust
; according to the base input, i.e. generic operators

(define (palindrome? num base)
  (define (reverse-num n result)
    (if (= n 0)
	result
	(reverse-num (quotient n base)
		     (+ (remainder n base) (* result base)))))

  (= num (reverse-num num 0)))
